# Exercise 02: Implement infrastructure with Copilot

## Scenario

This training will have you using Copilot features for development and also to automate devops delivery for the Zava solution.

In the previous exercise you set up your development environment with current state of Zava web-site solution and installed Visual Studio Code extensions to support devops automation. 

In this exercise, you will use GitHub Copilot to create an infrastructure GitHub issue and from Visual Studio Code you will use GitHub Copilot to generate the infrastructure Bicep scripts from the issue. This will also leverage Azure MCP Server for best practices. You will then deploy the infrastructure by running the script.

## Objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll be able to:

* Create a GitHub issue using Chat with Copilot
* Generate Bicep scripts from a GitHub issue using GitHub Copilot and Azure MCP Server
* Apply techniques for improving scripts iteratively with Copilot prompts
* Execute Bicep scripts to create infrastructure

## Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes

## Planning Resources

Before starting this exercise, review these planning guides to understand the Azure infrastructure requirements:

* **[Quick Reference Guide](QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Condensed checklist and key information for quick reference
* **[Azure Infrastructure Planning Guide](AZURE_INFRASTRUCTURE_PLANNING.md)** - Comprehensive planning document with architecture details, security requirements, cost considerations, and best practices
* **[Architecture Diagram](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Visual representation of the infrastructure components and their relationships
