# TechWorkshop L300: GitHub - Innovate with GitHub

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

This lab guides you through a series of practical exercises focused on modernising Zava's business applications and databases by migrating everything to Azure, leveraging GitHub Enterprise, Copilot, and Azure services. Each exercise is designed to deliver hands-on experience in governance, automation, security, AI integration, and observability, ensuring Zava’s transition to Azure is robust, secure, and future-ready.

- **CI/CD Automation**: Build GitHub Actions pipelines and deploy to Azure
- **Security Best Practices**: Leverage GitHub Advanced Security features (Dependabot, Secret Protection, Code Security)
- **AI-Powered Development**: Refactor legacy code, build AI chatbot agents using Copilot and Microsoft Foundry
- **Observability**: Monitor and govern AI model usage with Azure Monitor and Application Insights
